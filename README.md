# Google Drive Malware Scanner

Recently, I got an e-mail from Google Drive telling me that I was sharing files that it had identified as malware. I had numerous shared folders, including one containing over 10,000 files organized into several levels of subfolders, and Google gives you no mechanism to scan your Drive or list out the files it's flagged as malware. So I was left in the dark about what I was sharing that was problematic, and couldn't fix the problem.

Thus, I built this tool, which uses the Drive API checks every file in your Drive to see whether Google has identified it as abusive. It does this by taking advantage of the fact that using `files.get` to download an abusive file [will fail unless you pass an `acknowledgeAbuse` parameter](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/files/get).

## Usage

### Create Google Drive API project

See [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/nodejs) about how to do this. Download and save the `credentials.json` file for your project.

### Set up repository

1. Clone the repo.
2. Place the `credentials.json` for your API project in the `./credentials` credentials directory.
3. Run `yarn`.
4. Set the following environment variables:
    ```sh
    CREDENTIALS_PATH=./credentials/credentials.json
    TOKEN_PATH=./credentials/token.json
    OUTPUT_PATH=./data/results.json # Optional
    ```

### Authorize your application

Run `yarn authorize`. You'll be given a URL to visit, where you'll be prompted to grant your application access to your Drive. You'll need to click the Advanced link to see the option to continue.

After authorizing everything, you'll be given a code to paste in the command-line.

```sh
$ yarn authorize
Authorize this app by visiting this url: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?...
Enter the code from that page here: ...
Access token created.
{
  access_token: '...',
  refresh_token: '...',
  scope: 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive',
  token_type: 'Bearer',
  expiry_date: ...
}
Token stored to ./credentials/token.json
âœ¨  Done in 36.95s.
```

This will save your token into the location specified for `TOKEN_PATH`.

### Scan your drive

Run `yarn scan`.

```sh
$ yarn scan
Discovered: 30 (1 pages)
Processing: 0
Skipped: 3
Checked: 27

Finished

Issues: 1
eicar.com: cannotDownloadAbusiveFile https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W_xVFXrZi-M8Nizev1Ia9wd6ga_ouISX/view?usp=drivesdk
Detailed results saved to ./data/results.json.
```

If you set the `OUTPUT_PATH` variable, the app will create a JSON file with details about the files that had issues.

## Notes

* The app will scan only files that have been added to your Drive. Files only in Shared With Me or Recent Files will not be scanned.
* If you need to recreate your `token.json` file (because you want to connect to a different Drive, or because the refresh token has expired), run `yarn authorize --reauthorize`.
* The scan will skip files over 25MB, because the `files.get` call can take quite some time for large files, and AFAICT they don't get malware-scanned by Drive anyway.
